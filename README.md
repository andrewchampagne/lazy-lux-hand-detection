# Lazy Lux: League of Legends Hand Gesture Controller

## Overview
Lazy Lux is a Python-based tool designed to enhance your gameplay experience in League of Legends by allowing you to control in-game abilities using hand signals. This project utilizes machine learning and computer vision to recognize specific hand gestures and map them to keyboard inputs corresponding to your champion's abilities.

## Start the GUI Application:
Run the main script to open the Tkinter GUI:

```
python main.py
```
Control the Script:

Start: Click the "Start Lazy Lux" button to begin recognizing hand gestures and simulating key presses.  
Stop: Click the "Stop Lazy Lux" button to halt the script.  

### Notes:
Ensure your camera is active and properly positioned.  

his project uses a machine learning model that requires specific training data to function correctly.  

Due to privacy concerns and the specific nature of the data used for training, the data files have been excluded from this repository. Instead, you will need to create your own dataset for the model, which can be done by running **collect_imgs.py**
